# Top 10 List of Week 04

1. [Logical - Physical Address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/logical-and-physical-address-in-operating-system/)<br>
   Logical Address is virtual address as it does not exist physically while Physical Address identifies a physical location of required data in a memory.


2. [MMU: Memory Management Unit](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/4768/memory-management-unit-mmu)<br>
    MMU determining whether the data needs to be retrieved from RAM or ROM storage.

3. [Static - Dynamic Linking](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/static-and-dynamic-linking-in-operating-systems/)<br>
    In terms of both physical memory and disk-space usage, static linking much more efficient to load the system libraries into memory only once. Dynamic linking allows this single loading to happen.

4. [Contiguous - Noncontiguous Memory Allocation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-contiguous-and-noncontiguous-memory-allocation/)<br>
   Contiguous is slower to proceed than Noncontiguous bun easier for OS to handle.

5. [Abstract Data Types](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/abstract-data-types/)<br>

6. [R : basic tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/r/index.htm)<br>
   Learn this and thank me later!

7. [Embedded System](https://internetofthingsagenda.techtarget.com/definition/embedded-system)<br>
   A mobile phone is not an embedded system, it is a combination of embedded systems that together allow it to perform a variety of general-purpose tasks.

8. [Remember Windows Phone?](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3336057/how-microsoft-failed-with-windows-10-mobile.html)<br>
    Windows Mobileâ€™s failure was Windows itself, an OS designed for a big screen, crammed into a little screen product. Its understandable. its like windows but not    really act like one.

9. [Does Autonomus Vechicles fits Indonesia?](https://archive.curbed.com/2016/9/21/12991696/driverless-cars-safety-pros-cons)<br>
    Not yet.

10. [Japan did it: Flying Vechicle](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/29/us/flying-car-successful-test-in-japan-trnd/index.html)<br>
