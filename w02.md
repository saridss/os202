# Top 10 List of Week 02

1. [Sandbox](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/sandbox)<br>
   Software that helps in software testing. On top of that, this software can tell what will a malicious things do with our computer if we get infected by pretending has    machine environment, so the malicious thing it was in true environment.

2. [Hash Function](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cryptography/cryptography_hash_functions.htm)<br>
   Function that used in digital signature. It created a fixed-length values, even when we input shorter than the fixed-length, it would create the fixed-length value.

3. [Keystroke logging - Keylogger](https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/keylogger)<br>
   Remembering every type that we made (since it monitored keyboard). Dont worry, not only the keyboard it can sabotage (wether legal or not) our camera as well as the      microphone.

4. [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChapterIntroduction.html)<br>
   Network analysis tools. Can use it as a packet sniffer. With decode ability, we could see inside of the packet that caught.

5. [Spoofing](https://www.phishing.org/phishing-and-spoofing)<br>
   One method in phising that frame user into "login" in scam web or simply make user click URL from scam email. Becareful! As long as we more thoughtful before clicking    -even typing, its gonna be fine.

6. [Blockchain network](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp)<br>
    Like a library that store many kind of books, block chain is a huge and many machines that store data (it has to be important data i believe). Banking system using       this to monitored everything (re: money).

7. [Bitcoin/Cryptocurrency](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/bitcoin/bitcoin_cryptocurrencies.htm)<br>
   Using blockchain netrork, bitcoin is used by many people to avoid transfer funds -and obviously taxes- This is safe since the system uses cryptography to secure its      transactions (even in annonymous mode). So this is kinda scary since the system can be used for something illegal, something like human trafficking payment. 

8. [Network Traffic Analysis](https://awakesecurity.com/glossary/network-traffic-analysis/)<br>
   Look number 4, using the tools, we can do this. There are many thing that can be analysed, but in real life, it doesnt have to be the packet, knowing who and who that    are having a network is enough.

9. [CIA Triad](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/the-cia-triad-in-cryptography/?ref=lbp)<br>
   This is the basic model (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) that can shows how secure is the network. This model helps to categorize security problem, so it      helps to focusing which part needed to solving the problem


10. [HTTPS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-http-and-https/?ref=lbp)<br>
    Obviously S in the word HTTP refers to secure! As we know HTTP is a protocol, HTTPS add a cryptographic protocol such as SSL/TLS. HTTPS helps reduce the possibility     that the web is malicious.
