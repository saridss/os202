# Top 10 List of Week 03

1. [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)<br>
A free static web-generator!

2. [R](https://www.guru99.com/r-programming-introduction-basics.html)<br>
Nope, its not an abbreviation of Ruby. Its another programming language that suitable for datamining (re: has many libraries for this algorithm).

3. [.swp](https://fileinfo.com/extension/swp)<br>
Stores the recovery version of a file that is being edited in the vi program.

4. [WAFL File System](https://www.slideshare.net/taotao1240/wafl-overview)<br>
WAFL stores metadata. It tracks changes similarly to journaling file systems as logs.

5. [dynamic random-access memory (DRAM)](https://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/DRAM)<br>
A type of random access semiconductor memory that stores each bit of data in a memory cell consisting of a tiny capacitor and a transistor. Used in personal computers (PCs), workstations and servers

6. [Non-volatile random-access memory (NVRAM)](https://techterms.com/definition/nvram#:~:text=Stands%20for%20%22Non%2DVolatile%20Random,power%20such%20as%20a%20battery.)<br>
Is random-access memory that retains data without applied power.

7. [static random-access memory (SRAM)](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/2814/static-random-access-memory-sram)<br>
is a type of RAM that holds data in a static form, that is, as long as the memory has power. Unlike dynamic RAM, it does not need to be refreshed.

8. [Ferroelectric RAM](https://www.electronics-notes.com/articles/electronic_components/semiconductor-ic-memory/fram-ferroelectric-ram-memory.php)<br>
is a random-access memory similar in construction to DRAM but using a ferroelectric layer instead of a dielectric layer to achieve non-volatility

9. [Magnetoresistive RAM](https://www.mram-info.com/introduction)<br>
MRAM is a memory technology that uses electron spin to store information can resist high radiation, can operate in extreme temperature conditions, and can be tamper resistant

10. [Phase-change RAM](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/about/innovation---technology/PCM.html)<br>
With single-bit alterability, PCM technology delivers significantly better write and comparable read performance than Flash-based memories that require at least a byte- or sector-erase cycle before reprogramming
