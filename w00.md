# Top 10 List of Week 00

1. [Computer History](https://www.livescience.com/20718-computer-history.html)<br>
it's fascinating how computer evolved from only can solve simple mechanism to the complex one by binary computing

2. [API](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/what-is-an-api)<br>
In the computing world that full of languages, without API its harder for systems with different language to communicate. Its like interpreter that we use to compile our code so computer understand what are the task it should do.

3. [Hypervisor](https://www.it-jurnal.com/apa-itu-hypervisor/)<br>
It's like a hardware but in a software since its task is handling one or more virtual machine. 

4. [Interrupts](https://www.mahirkoding.com/pengenalan-interrupt/)<br>
Interrupts help computer to do more tasks with no burdensome to the processor.

5. [Architecture: clustered systems](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/Clustered-Systems)<br>
Increasing performance and availability without increasing the cost.

6. [GitHub](https://www.howtogeek.com/180167/htg-explains-what-is-github-and-what-do-geeks-use-it-for/)<br>
Has some function with Git, GitHub is equipped with "Hub" which means user can network with other users without have to "log" to the git.

7. [Virtual memory](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/)<br>


8. [Tradeoffs](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/parallel_computer_architecture/parallel_computer_architecture_hardware_software_tradeoffs.htm)<br>


9. [Logical Layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9)<br>
