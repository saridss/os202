# Top 10 List of Week 00

1. [Computer History](https://www.livescience.com/20718-computer-history.html)<br>
it's fascinating how computer evolved from only can solve simple mechanism to the complex one by binary computing

2. [API](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/what-is-an-api)<br>
In the computing world that full of languages, without API its harder for systems with different language to communicate. Its like interpreter that we use to compile our code so computer understand what are the task it should do.

3. [Hypervisor](https://www.it-jurnal.com/apa-itu-hypervisor/)<br>
It's like a hardware but in a software since its task is handling one or more virtual machine. 

4. [Interrupts](https://www.mahirkoding.com/pengenalan-interrupt/)<br>
Interrupts help computer to do more tasks with no burdensome to the processor.

5. [Architecture: clustered systems](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/Clustered-Systems)<br>
Increasing performance and availability without increasing the cost.

6. [GitHub](https://www.howtogeek.com/180167/htg-explains-what-is-github-and-what-do-geeks-use-it-for/)<br>
Has some function with Git, GitHub is equipped with "Hub" which means user can network with other users without have to "log" to the git.

7. [Virtual memory](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/)<br>
Systems that make secondary memory allocated to be main memory. Helps computer with small RAM to execute "huge" application

8. [Port](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-is-network-port)<br>
Port, both physical and networking, is a "door" to connect computer to other sources. While physical port is like a "key hole" that need inserted by "the key" to get connected, network port using numbers.

9. [Multithreading](https://www.javatpoint.com/multithreading-in-java)<br>
Both multithreading and multiprocessing support computer to do more tasks at the same time. The difference is that multithreading cos is low since they can share the memory. In other hand, multiprocessing cost is high since it assign memory per task.

10. [Kernel](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kernel-in-operating-system/)<br>
Connector between software and hardware. When a software wants to turn indicator lamp on, it asks kernel to turn it on.
